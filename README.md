# 👋 Hi, I'm Leon Ronaldo

I’m a full-stack engineer who builds **real, complex products** — not just UI demos or CRUD apps.

I’ve worked across **Flutter, React, Node.js, and Django**, shipping mobile and web systems that involve authentication, realtime communication, media handling, and AI-driven features.

What I enjoy most is building **systems that actually survive reality** — real users, real bugs, real scaling problems.

## 🧠 How I work

I don’t think in “screens” or “features”.  
I think in **systems**.

That means:
- How data flows  
- How authentication breaks  
- How users misuse things  
- How APIs fail  
- How UIs behave under stress  

I’ve dealt with:
- Token expiration and refresh loops  
- WebSocket disconnects and invalid sessions  
- Image upload pipelines  
- Role-based access across apps  
- Memory and state across long-running AI conversations  

These are not tutorial problems — they show up only when you build something real.

## 🛠️ Technical Focus

### Frontend
- React (TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind)
- Flutter (Mobile + Web)
- Complex layouts, custom UI systems, animations
- Canvas-style interactions & non-standard shapes

### Backend
- Node.js (Express)
- Django & Django REST Framework
- JWT authentication (access + refresh token flows)
- WebSocket authentication & session handling
- Role-based API design

### Data & Architecture
- Database entity design & relationship mapping
- MongoDB & PostgreSQL
- Token lifecycles and security logic
- AI memory & conversation persistence models

### Other
- Git, production builds, deployments
- Image upload systems using signed URLs
- Play Store publishing
- Arduino & hardware-side logic

## 🚀 Key Projects

### **Ardour AI**
A platform with **human-like AI characters** that:
- Have memory
- Build personality
- Maintain conversation history
- Interact like social entities

I designed the architecture for:
- AI memory systems
- WebSocket-based real-time interaction
- Authenticated live conversations
- Frontend that behaves like a social platform

### **Eintransport**
A real logistics platform built for a real client.

Includes:
- Flutter mobile app (published to Play Store)
- Backend APIs
- Role-based access
- Status tracking
- Client-side and admin workflows

This wasn’t a demo — it was used by actual users.

## ⚔️ Things I’ve actually dealt with

Not buzzwords — real problems:

- JWT refresh token hell across multiple projects  
- WebSocket auth & invalid-token disconnect bugs  
- Secure image uploads using signed URLs  
- Flutter animation systems for production UI  
- AI memory & long-term conversation state  
- Role-based access control for real clients  
- Production builds and Play Store publishing  

If you’ve built real apps, you know how painful these are.
